## How to allocate spend across a marketing department

How should I allocate spend to different marketing channels? If you're managing a company's marketing budget, this may be the most essential question to maximize your revenue/profits given limited spend. There's essentially two ways to answer it scientifically:
1. Look from the top down: take all of your data on which days (/weeks, etc.) you spent on which channels, and when your revenue came in. Then, use a **media mix model** (MMM - also called marketing mix modeling) to determine which channels drove your KPIs, and which contributed less or none.
2. Look from the bottom up: use as granular data as possible on which customers saw which ads, and if/when those customers converted. Use a **multi-touch attribution model** (MTA) to determine which ads drove each purchase/conversion, then sum your results by channel to see how valuable each one is.
At Wayfair, we focused on MTA to get hyper granular results, which let us optimize our marketing channels down to the performance of an individual ad. This worked very well as a mature company (sorry Wayfair you're not a startup) with mountains of data to analyze and a large staff of data scientists to build and validate a complex model. It also let us analyze the customer journey at a deep level, looking at what touchpoints contributed to success, for example. MMM, on the other hand, provides a high level view only, by taking in aggregate data by channel. However, even at a company with MTA, running MMM a couple times a year can help validate what the attribution is showing, providing a general view of which channels are driving outcomes.
