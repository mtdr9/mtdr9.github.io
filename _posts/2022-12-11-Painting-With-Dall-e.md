[DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) is amazing. I've been using it to make everything from abstract inspiration for acrylic paintings to my favorite Super Smash Bros. characters reimagined as renaissance era royalty. But creating great AI art takes more than a button press: you also need a great prompt. In this article, I'll give my advice to getting good results, having created a few thousand AI-generated images. I'll also make a few callouts of problems with AI art and potential mitigating factors.

**How to write a great DALL-E prompt**

The two big ones:
1. Describe the specific **content** you want to see; include details about the foreground or background
2. Add what **medium** you'd like represented, such as a photo, pencil drawing, watercolour painting, digital art, etc. My favorite is "oil painting"

Additional style tags:  
3. Artist (if you want an impressionist oil painting, write Monet or Cezanne; if you want something freaky, write Hieronymus Bosch)
    a. You can also name an artist's style, such as "cubism" or "surrealism". But IMO artist names work better, and allow more precision
4. Lighting - brightly lit, gloomy
5. Color scheme - e.g. triadic, red, sepia
6. Composition - landscape, close-up, ultra wide-angle

Here's a few samples of artwork generated using the features above.

**Problems with AI art**
Copyrights - the works they’re trained on are often copyrighted
Death of art - as more art becomes AI-generated, there’ll be less novel art produced
Bias and stereotypes - AI can both be used to create harmful images (e.g. hate image speech), and may reinforce harmful stereotypes

**Mitigating factors with AI art problems**
Copyrights - this is tough. We’ll probably see a lot of change in the industry
Death of art - not a huge deal. Novel work will still be incentivized, and we’ll see the rise of AI-assisted artists. Some artists will be displaced, others will learn new skills and thrive
Bias - it’s up to communities to moderate content. No one would take back the written word because it can be used to distribute hate
