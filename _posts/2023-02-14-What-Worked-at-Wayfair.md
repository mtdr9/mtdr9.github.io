In four years as a search marketer, I built - with the help of my team of analysts and our partners in data science, ad tech, and storefront - $87 million of annualized, incremental revenue for Wayfair. This post isn't about any specific project, but rather the broad themes that allowed me to make the right bets and execute them quickly, as well as some of the lessons learned from bets that didn't pay off. Summing it all up, it came from empowering my team to work on the right things, and unblocking them effectively and proactively.

And breaking it down a little, here are my three rules for success. Now, my uncle once recommended me a book of 11 rules for business, none of which are featured here, so your mileage may vary.

1. Define what's important and what's not
2. Manage your analysts to their skill level
3. Be your own coach

**1. Define what's important and what's not**

From a single 90 minute focus session to a 2-year roadmap, knowing what to focus on makes it so much more likely that by the quarterly performance slide, you'll have achieved some substantial, measureable results to write in. And it'll even let you manage upwards, telling your boss "I can get that done, but I think we should focus on A and B first, for reason X".

My key insight here is that different prioritization techniques work best for different time horizons. Here are explanations of the 3 techniques I'll be discussing, courtesy of ChatGPT:

RICE prioritization
> The RICE prioritization framework is a popular tool used by many product managers and project managers. It stands for Risk, Impact, Confidence, and Effort, and it is used to prioritize tasks or projects based on four key factors.
> 1. Risk: This factor measures the potential risks associated with the task or project. For example, a project that involves developing a new product has a higher risk than a project that involves minor improvements to an existing product.
> 2. Impact: This factor measures the potential impact of the task or project. For example, a project that has the potential to significantly increase revenue has a higher impact than a project that has a minor impact on revenue.
> 3. Confidence: This factor measures the level of confidence that the team has in the task or project. For example, a project that has a well-defined plan and clear objectives has a higher confidence level than a project that lacks clarity and structure.
> 4. Effort: This factor measures the amount of effort required to complete the task or project. For example, a project that requires a significant amount of time and resources has a higher effort level than a project that requires minimal effort.  

> To use the RICE prioritization framework, assign a score to each of these four factors, and then multiply them together to get a final score. For example, if a project has a risk score of 8, an impact score of 7, a confidence score of 9, and an effort score of 5, its RICE score would be 2520 (8 x 7 x 9 x 5).

Effort vs. Value
> The effort vs. value framework is a simple and effective way to prioritize tasks or projects based on their potential value and the effort required to complete them.
> 1. Effort: This factor measures the amount of effort required to complete the task or project. For example, a project that requires a significant amount of time and resources has a higher effort level than a project that requires minimal effort.
> 2. Value: This factor measures the potential value of the task or project. For example, a project that has the potential to significantly increase revenue has a higher value than a project that has a minor impact on revenue.  

> To use the effort vs. value framework, plot each task or project on a graph with effort on the x-axis and value on the y-axis. Tasks or projects that require high effort but have low value should be deprioritized, while tasks or projects that have high value and low effort should be prioritized.

Urgency vs. Importance
> The urgency vs. importance framework is a classic tool used to prioritize tasks or projects based on their urgency and importance.
> 1. Urgency: This factor measures how quickly the task or project needs to be completed. For example, a task that has a tight deadline has a higher urgency than a task with a more relaxed deadline.
> 2. Importance: This factor measures the importance of the task or project. For example, a task that is critical to the success of a project has a higher importance than a task that is not critical.  

> To use the urgency vs. importance framework, plot each task or project on a matrix with urgency on the x-axis and importance on the y-axis. Tasks or projects that are both urgent and important should be prioritized, while tasks or projects that are not urgent or important should be deprioritized.
