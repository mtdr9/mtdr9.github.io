In four years as a search marketer, I built - with the help of my team of analysts and our partners in data science, ad tech, and storefront - $87 million of annualized, incremental revenue for Wayfair. This post isn't about any specific project, but rather the broad themes that allowed me to make the right bets and execute them quickly, as well as some of the lessons learned from bets that didn't pay off. Summing it all up, it came from empowering my team to work on the right things, and unblocking them effectively and proactively.

And breaking it down a little, here are my three rules for success. Now, my uncle once recommended me a book of 11 rules for business, none of which are featured here; so your mileage may vary.

1. Define what's important and what's not
2. Manage your analysts to their skill level
3. Be your own coach
