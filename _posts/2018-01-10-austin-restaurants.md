Have you ever walked by a restaurant in New York with a big orange "C" on the window and wondered why anyone is eating there? Were those people on their phones as they walked in? Are they taking Eating as a pass/fail? Maybe they got sick last week but figure lightning doesn't strike twice.

When I found out that all of Austin's food inspection data is available, I wanted to see what the city's restaurants looked like across the board. Negativity sells, so here are all of Austin's restaurants by minimum health inspection score, 2015-2017. I've also included their most recent score, and, since food sanitation is a continuous commitment, their average score in this time period.

If you're curious about a street or neighboorhood in the graph above, try zooming and panning. And if you're walking around downtown, take a quick look before walking into, say, the crawfish shack - or you may not walk out.
