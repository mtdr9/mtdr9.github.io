Every time I see people eating in a New York restaurant with a big orange "C" on the window I wonder: why is anyone eating there? Maybe those people were on their phones as they walked in. Or they've never seen _Kitchen Nightmares_.

I'm planning to travel to Austin, and when I found out that all of their food inspection data is available, I wanted to see how the city's restaurants compared. Here they all are by their minimum inspection score, from 2015-2017. I've also included their most recent score, and, since food sanitation is a continuous commitment, their average score.

If you're curious about a street or neighboorhood in the graph above, try zooming and panning. And if you're walking around downtown, take a quick look before walking into, say, the crawfish shack - or you may not walk out.



### Additional Thoughts

Looking at the city's scores over time, there's not much change at the overall level.

Mean citywide scores fluctuate only slightly, with an insignificant regression coefficient (p = 0.670).
